## Description / Requirements

VisualAlgo is an algorithm visualizer, which visually recreates different sorting, search and traversal algorithms in an aesthetic and easy to understand way.

With this project, the goal was to practice and implement how to:

- Research and understand different data algorithms both visually and theoretically.
- Visually display different algorithms to the user.
- Create an aesthetic application which operated and handled user input and algorithms smoothly.
- Practice and learn about different algorithms and their use cases.
- Research and understand each algorithms time and space complexity.

---

## Build Steps

Clone the repository, and from the directory, run the following commands:

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```

---

## Design Goals / Approach

- The goal of this project was to create an algorithm visualizer which efficiently and intelligently displayed different algorithms back to the user.
- Emphasis on aesthetic and ease of use, with simple and efficient styling.
- Wanted the ability to randomize the data, so that the speed and efficiency of each algorithm can be seen with different datasets.
- Include multiple different algorithms for each section.
- Research different algorithms and display critical information on the screen (space and time complexity for each)

---

## Features

- **Sorting:** Ability to sort data using multiple different sorting algorithms (e.g. insertion sort, quick sort etc.).
- **Search:** Search for a target within a data set with different search algorithms (e.g. binary search, ternary search).
- **Tree Traversal:** Traverse a tree data structure with different search algorithms (e.g. depth first search and dijkstra's algorithm).
- **Realtime Data Visualization:** Watch the data be sorted / searched in real time with styling updates so you can visualize the different algorithms.
- **Speed and Efficiency:** Time and space complexity information provided, and watch it in real time, with each algorithms speed shown visually to the user.
- **Easy Navigation:** Simple and efficient design aesthetic with a simple navigation system to make it easy for the user to navigate the application.

---

### Technologies:

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **SCSS**
- **HTML**

---

## Future Goals

- Add more algorithms.
- Incorporate different data structures and corresponding algorithms.
- Add user control over data set size and range etc.

---

## Struggles

- Visualization of algorithms. Getting the application to visually represent what was happening within the sorting/search/traversal function.
- Traversal page. Visualizing a tree data structure was difficult to accomplish.
- Making sure that the algorithms didn't complete too fast. Adding delay.
